# RU203: Querying, Indexing, and Full-text Search with Redis

## Introduction

This repository contains example data and setup instructions for the Redis University course [RU203: Querying, Indexing, and Full-Text Search with Redis](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru203/).

To take this course, you'll first need do the following:

1. Clone this git repository
1. Get RediSearch and load the sample data
1. Build the RediSearch indexes by running the index creation commands

Need help getting started? Stop by the [Redis University Discord server](https://discord.gg/wYQJsk5c4A).

To get RediSearch, we recommend either launching it from Docker (for beginners) or building it from source and running the locally (more advanced).

> We are also currently trialling the use of [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) hosted environments for this course.  To use Gitod, you'll need a GitHub account and a web browser: there's no software to install locally.  See Option 3 for details.

## Option 1: Run RediSearch locally with Docker (Best option for beginners)

First, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### 1. Start Redis

Next, run the following command from your terminal:

```
docker run -it --rm --name redis-search -p 6379:6379  redislabs/redisearch:2.0.5
```

This will launch a Redis instance with RediSearch installed. The instance will be listening on localhost port 6379.

### 2. Load the sample data

The commands that load the sample data are in the file `commands.redis`, which is part of this git repository. To load this data, run the following command:

```
docker exec -i redis-search redis-cli < commands.redis > output.txt
```

Check the "output" file for "Invalid" responses.

```
grep Invalid output.txt
```

If you have any "Invalid" responses, you might not have RediSearch installed properly. If you have
any problems, find us on [our Discord
channel](https://discord.gg/wYQJsk5c4A).

### 3. Create the indexes

To create the indexes, first start the Redis CLI:

```
docker exec -it redis-search redis-cli
```

Then paste in the index creation commands (see the "Building Indexes" section for details).

## Option 2: Build RediSearch from source

### 1. Build RediSearch and launch Redis

First, follow the instructions for [building and running RediSearch from source](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/Quick_Start/#building_and_running_from_source).


### 2. Load the sample data

The commands that load the sample data are in the file `commands.redis`, which is part of this git repository. To load this data, run the following command from your terminal:

```
redis-cli < commands.redis > output.txt
```

This assumes that you have `redis-cli` in your path.

Check the "output" file for "Invalid" responses.

```
grep Invalid output.txt
```

If you have any "Invalid" responses, you might not have RediSearch installed properly. If you have
any problems, find us on [our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/wYQJsk5c4A).

### 3. Create the indexes

To create the indexes, first start the Redis CLI:

```
redis-cli
```

Then paste in the index creation commands (see the "Building Indexes" section for details).

## Option 3: Use a Gitpod Hosted Environment

TODO add Gitpod instructions and a launch button here...

Click the button below to start a new cloud development environment using Gitpod:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/simonprickett/ru203)

* Start an environment...
* Wait for it to load up...
* Load the data from the terminal in VSCode
* Open up RedisInsight from the pop up in VS Code
* Agree to terms for RedisInsight
* Back in your Gitpod workspace tab, dismiss the Redis 6379 pop up 

Note that you'll be working using the RedisInsight tab here.

Finally, paste in the index creation commands (see the "Building Indexes" section for details).

## Building Indexes

This data ships without RediSearch indexes, so you need to create them yourself.

We're going to give you all the commands you need to create these indexes, but
before you run these index commands, make sure you're in the redis CLI:

    $ redis-cli

Then run the following commands:

    FT.CREATE books-idx ON HASH PREFIX 1 ru203:book:details: SCHEMA isbn TAG SORTABLE title TEXT WEIGHT 2.0 SORTABLE subtitle TEXT SORTABLE thumbnail TAG NOINDEX description TEXT SORTABLE published_year NUMERIC SORTABLE average_rating NUMERIC SORTABLE authors TEXT SORTABLE categories TAG SEPARATOR ";" author_ids TAG SEPARATOR ";"

    FT.CREATE users-idx ON HASH PREFIX 1 ru203:user:details: SCHEMA first_name TEXT SORTABLE last_name TEXT SORTABLE email TAG SORTABLE escaped_email TEXT NOSTEM SORTABLE user_id TAG SORTABLE last_login NUMERIC SORTABLE

    FT.CREATE authors-idx ON HASH PREFIX 1 ru203:author:details: SCHEMA name TEXT SORTABLE author_id TAG SORTABLE

    FT.CREATE authors-books-idx ON HASH PREFIX 1 ru203:author:books: SCHEMA book_isbn TAG SORTABLE author_id TAG SORTABLE

    FT.CREATE checkouts-idx ON HASH PREFIX 1 ru203:book:checkout: SCHEMA user_id TAG SORTABLE book_isbn TAG SORTABLE checkout_date NUMERIC SORTABLE return_date NUMERIC SORTABLE checkout_period_days NUMERIC SORTABLE geopoint GEO

## Appendix: The Data Model

The queries in this repository rely on a data model composed of Redis
hashes. The entities in this data model include books, authors, library
checkouts, and users. The following diagram represents this data model:

```
    Authors
+--------------+
|  name        |               Author-Books
|              |            +----------------+
